# Website Comment System

Create a way to insert comments to a static website. There will be a list of comments and a comment submit form.

There should be a minimum barrier for a user to submit a comment.

Javascript is used to display the comment immediately for the admin and person who posted the comment.

Other visitors only see approved comments.

Minimum requirements to post a comment are Name and Message.

## Front End

Coded in Javascript using a Framework such as Vue

## Back End

Coded in Golang or PHP. This will run as a server on a special port (if it uses Golang). The webserver will forward requests for the API to this port.

There will be a simple API.

The data will be stored to Database such as MySQL which allows for using an Admin panel.

## Forum

Combine with Forum software in order to have discussion and members. Saves reinventing the wheel for member signup etc.
